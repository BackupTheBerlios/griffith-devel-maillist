Subject: [Griffith-devel] tried griffith, back with first questions
Message-ID: <AANLkTimoT+kZnXx9jof2OgPLDF3vfDz6yrgTZePihGXP@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

I just installed svn trunk and have to say I'm very pleased with griffith!
Thanks a lot to all who has worked on this great application!

Since documentation is quite scarce (non-existent :)) I'd like to ask
a couple of questions here:

1.

I have hundreds of movied on both my local file system and on an
external hard drive. My original intention was using griffith for
cataloguing these films but couldn't find a way of automatically
importing all films at once. The format for each avi file is similar
to this:

scorsese-1990-goodfellas.avi

i.e. it is director-date-title.avi and if the title has spaces in it,
it is replaced by an underscore as in

leigh-1996-secrets_and_lies.avi

so the ideal thing would be if I could feed griffith the directory
where these are stored and it would walk the entire directory
structure recursively and add all films. I'm guessing I need to write
some sort of a plugin for this.

Can you provide some pointers where I need to look in the source for this?

2.

When I launch griffith with the --debug option I see tons of
deprecation warnings. Are there plans to fix these? Should patches be
submitted?

3.

Is there any support for storing information about subtitle files?

Well, that's about it for now :)

Cheers,
Daniel
