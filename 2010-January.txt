Subject: [Griffith-devel] Update of plugins/movie/PluginMovieMyMoviesIt.py
Message-ID: <4B4746BE.5060803@gmail.com>

I am an Italian programmer and i saw that there are no working plugins
for Italian databases.
I have updated the MyMoviesIt plugin and now it is working. There is
only one todo pending: the cast is recognized for 90% movies.
All other infos are working, rating too.
The diff patch if attached.

The other Italian plugin "Cinematografo" isn't working.
If you think that possible, if i get svn access to plugin/movie folder
only, i will correct some plugins; otherwise remove it.
Thank you for the useful good work, nice code, simple to edit.

Hi Filippo,

thanks for your work.
> The other Italian plugin "Cinematografo" isn't working.

The current svn version of the plugin works.
You can try it if you fetch the current one from the svn repository and
put it over the original version of your installation.

Michael

Hi guys!
I've just discovered your wonderful software, for which I thanks you a lot.

Since I'm Italian, I was missing the plugin for IMDB Italian version. So 
I write it, and is working fine now.  It's working quite well right now. 
I've made just a change from PluginMovieIMDB.py, the original title is 
fetched from imdb.com.

Hope it helps!

Thanks a lot for your work, if no one have problems, i can check it and
upload it to svn.
I'm an Italian programmer and user, too, so, thanks from me personally.

Plugin committed to svn as rev 1401.
Done only one small correction on tagline note.

@dev: Griffith-svn list moderated my automatic notification message.

Thanks Enrico
