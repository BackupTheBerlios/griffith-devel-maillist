you have to create new import plugin (in lib/plugins/imp/). I just took
a look at lib/plugins/imp/__init__.py and I don't like what I wrote
there so maybe wait a little bit for new interface. I might actually
write this import plugin while working on new base class...

most of them are due to using Glade, nobody had time to upgrade to
GtkBuilder yet. Patches are always welcome :-)

yes there is. It's in the same window where you can define audio tracks

Thanks  a lot for the reply! In the meantime I started writing an
extension for the above scenario but maybe writing an import plugin is
even better. But then I'll keep an eye on trunk for the new base
class.

I see, I'm not familiar with GtkBuilder nor with Glade, but will look into it.

Great!

actually it will be a complete rewrite of Griffith, I will push my files
to gitorious? once I will be happy my 2.X branch

Great, that is good to hear!

Hi Piotr,

Now that you mentioned that a major rewrite is in the works I thought
I would mention a feature that maybe will prove useful to several
users.

Immediately after starting using griffith I really liked the 'seen'
field on each record. However most of the time I watch movies with my
girlfriend and some movies I have seen, some movies she has seen, etc
(there are 4 combinations :)) and it would be nice to have 2 fields,
'seen by me' and 'seen by her'. I thought about an arbitrary number of
'seen' fields (the actual number could be defined in preferences per
user), but that's probably an overkill and two are enough.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Daniel

I'm thinking about allowing to add new fields via extensions so that
everyone can add new "unofficial" field. It has be placed outside
"movies" table so that the same database will work for people that don't
have given extension installed/enabled.

That sounds like a good idea, but how realistic is it to move around
the database from one griffith installation with the extension to
another griffith installation without the extension? I mean if a user
installs the extension and adds a field, then probably he/she will not
want to use this database with another installation of griffith
without the extension, I'd think.

I guess the question is how frequently people share databases across
griffith installations. I'd think not very often, but I might be wrong
of course since I'm quite new here :)

Cheers,
Daniel

dunno how common sharing SQLite database (f.e. over NFS) is, but I added
PostgreSQL and MySQL support to allow sharing a database in the first
place.

as long as they use the same Griffith version, it should be ok to share
f.e. PostgreSQL database

I see, makes sense!

Sure, I agree.

Then, as I've said, I'll keep an eye on gitorious :)
