<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> Immediately after starting using griffith I really liked the 'seen'
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> field on each record. However most of the time I watch movies with my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> girlfriend and some movies I have seen, some movies she has seen, etc
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (there are 4 combinations :)) and it would be nice to have 2 fields,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'seen by me' and 'seen by her'. I thought about an arbitrary number of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'seen' fields (the actual number could be defined in preferences per
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> user), but that's probably an overkill and two are enough.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking about allowing to add new fields via extensions so that
</I>&gt;<i> everyone can add new &quot;unofficial&quot; field. It has be placed outside
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;movies&quot; table so that the same database will work for people that don't
</I>&gt;<i> have given extension installed/enabled.
</I>
That sounds like a good idea, but how realistic is it to move around
the database from one griffith installation with the extension to
another griffith installation without the extension? I mean if a user
installs the extension and adds a field, then probably he/she will not
want to use this database with another installation of griffith
without the extension, I'd think.

I guess the question is how frequently people share databases across
griffith installations. I'd think not very often, but I might be wrong
of course since I'm quite new here :)

Cheers,
Daniel
