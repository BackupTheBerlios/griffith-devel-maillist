<PRE>Hi Piotr,

Now that you mentioned that a major rewrite is in the works I thought
I would mention a feature that maybe will prove useful to several
users.

Immediately after starting using griffith I really liked the 'seen'
field on each record. However most of the time I watch movies with my
girlfriend and some movies I have seen, some movies she has seen, etc
(there are 4 combinations :)) and it would be nice to have 2 fields,
'seen by me' and 'seen by her'. I thought about an arbitrary number of
'seen' fields (the actual number could be defined in preferences per
user), but that's probably an overkill and two are enough.

What do you think?

Cheers,
Daniel
