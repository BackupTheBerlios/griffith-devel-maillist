Hello all!

My name is Antonio and I am a linux user from Madrid, Spain. I have to
say that I have been using this program since two days ago and its
great!! I like it so much. For this reason I would like to work on that
things that neccesary.

I have seen that there isnt traslation to spanish of the griffith web
site, I just want to say that I can help on this translation (if
possible and desired), as well as some Errata on the spanish translation
of the application ("Herrameintas" instead of "Herramientas", "Codeces"
instead of "C?decs", "Necisitas" instead of "Necesitas", etc).

Anyway, so much thanks for the development of this program.

Un saludo,

Antonio.

There's a page on wiki [1] where you can pick something (f.e. we really
need someone to write/update the docs)

Hi,

I've moved our wiki to the new domain (new address:
http://wiki.griffith.cc). There are rewrite rules on berlios so that old
wiki will redirect users to the right place, I've also added the same
rules in old forum.

While I was playing with the domain stuff, I also added few email
aliases. If a contributor wants a fancy name at griffith.cc email address -
contact me in private.
