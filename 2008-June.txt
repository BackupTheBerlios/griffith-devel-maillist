Hi Stefan,

Thanks for your work :-). I plan to rewrite the whole export plugin
system and add Mako support, which is more powerful than my simple
template engine. Once I finish it, it will be possible to do what you
implemented using templates only (i.e. without adding new export
plugin).

I stuck with this SQLAlchemy transition (0.5 will be released
soon and Griffith doesn't even work with 0.4.x as expected yet) and
rewriting it is not fun (adding new features is fun), but I plan to
spend some more time on Griffith next month... anyway, people are not
really contributing, so I wasn't motivated to work on Griffith lately
(despite the fact that my day job and Debian consumes lots of my time)
