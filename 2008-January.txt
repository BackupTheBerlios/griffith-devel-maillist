Subject: [Griffith-devel] Griffith 0.9.6 release plans
Message-ID: <20080107162258.GA4079@pox.one.pl>

Hi guys,

I will be in Frankfurt this week, so I will not have time for Griffith
(again :-( ). I started the SQLAlchemy 0.4.x transition but there's
still much to fix, so I guess we should release 0.9.6 *with* SA 0.3.11
(i.e. not as external dependency) soon. I will be back on Saturday
evening and will prepare packages (Debian, Ubuntu) and tarballs
(with SA)

What do you think? 0.9.6 with SA on Sunday evening?

That's ok for me.

I will not have any time soon too. I think will be not easy to make
major progresses on the project on the next couple months or so.

But because current packages are really outdated I think we should
release 0.9.6 with Alchemy 0.3.11.

Sunday is ok.

It sounds good to me.
I think it's time for a new 0.9.x release.

I only want to check some plugins till Sunday. There is also a little 
problem with fetching posters
from Amazon if you don't use the US version. I hope I can fix it too.

I don't find the time to fix the amazon interface before the 0.9.6 release.
It's not a critical error. I think the new version of griffith can be 
released without a fix for that.

SQLAlchemy is already in 0.9.x branch, I will check all reported bugs
and Polish movie plugins tomorrow.

I will try to fix portuguese plugins tonight. I'm afraid I will not
make it earlier.

sorry for very late reply :-(

Database structure changes a lot, so I guess it's better to take a look
at lib/sql.py file - search for line containing "prepare tables interface",
I think you will not have problems with finding right date there (IMHO
it's clear)

Better late then never :)
Thanks for the reply, I'll do that and see what I can make of the
file. I have looked at it a bit and though it to be straight forward
but nevertheless a ER diagram always helps, that's why I asked.

Thanks again for the reply, best regards,

S?rgio Lopes
