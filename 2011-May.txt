Sorry, I don't know. I tried different shortcuts but I didn't find any
to jump to the next result.

Hi folks,

Thanks for all the advice on adding the 'Any' column in the drop down
many on the main window for searching for (almost) any field. I found
that including ( 'director', 'title', 'o_title', 'cameraman', 'cast',
'year' ) is the most useful option, not too many and not too few. The
patch is attached, or should I send patches to
https://bugs.launchpad.net/griffith ?

Michael, I followed your advice and modified the already sorted list
self.search_criteria_sorted in the function combos in initialize.py.

Cheers,
Daniel
